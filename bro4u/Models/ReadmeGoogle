1.Get a configuration file
2.Add the configuration file to your project

Drag the GoogleService-Info.plist file you just downloaded into the root of your Xcode project and add it to all targets.

Add URL schemes to your project

Google Sign-in requires two custom URL Schemes to be added to your project. To add the custom schemes:

Open your project configuration: double-click the project name in the left tree view. Select your app from the TARGETS section, then select the Info tab, and expand the URL Types section.
Click the + button, and add a URL scheme for your reversed client ID. To find this value, open the GoogleService-Info.plist configuration file, and look for the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID key. Copy the value of that key, and paste it into the URL Schemes box on the configuration page. Leave the other fields blank.
Click the + button, and add a second URL scheme. This one is the same as your app's bundle ID. For example, if your bundle ID is com.example.app, type that value into the URL Schemes box. You can find your app's bundle ID in the General tab of the project configuration (Identity > Bundle Identifier).
